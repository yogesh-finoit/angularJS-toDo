Todo example in AngularJS
========================

### How to run
1. Get the code first
2. On root folder run `bower install` (you should have installed bower as a global in your system. install from here [Bower](https://bower.io/). Once the dependencies are installed will be available inside `src/vendors` )
3. When all dependencies get installed, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer[PORT]` or any other server.


1. **Tip** : *whenever you bower install, use `--save -dev`, e.g.: `bower install angular --save -dev ` it will save your dependencies and help in future too.*
